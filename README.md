A user friendly wrapper for manipulating OS X application's Recently Opened menu lists. Lovingly inspired by [a shell script](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3200017?start=0&tstart=0) I found on Apple's support forums.

There's nothing more irritating than scurrying about before a presentation to clear out of your browser(s) history and Recently Opened menu lists.

absent__minded__professor to the rescue!
